This project contains implementations of several standard sorting algorithms, along with a small test of each.

Included:
    Quicksort
    Mergesort
    Bubble sort
    Cocktail sort
    Insertion sort
    Radix sort
    Heap sort

Future additions planned:
    Selection sort
    Shellsort
    Combsort

Note that the statistics are not completely useful since standard deviation is not
computed currently, and sorts such as mergesort do not actually swap items while
radixsort does not compare items.

To build:
g++ -o sorttest src/*.cpp -I include/ -std=c++11

All of the code is released under the X11 Public License (MIT License).
